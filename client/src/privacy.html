					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
					<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 3, 2025</p>

					<p>
						The Beynum Company ("we," "us," or "our") operates the 
						Virtual Team Parent application (the "Service"). This Privacy 
						Policy is to inform you of our policies regarding the access, 
						use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Our commitment to you is simple: <strong>We respect your 
						privacy.</strong> We have designed our Service to be a tool that 
						<strong>you</strong> control, operating with your explicit 
						permission.
					</p>

					<h2>Our Data Policy: Limited Use with Your Permission</h2>
					<p>
						To function, the Virtual Team Parent service requires your explicit 
						permission to access certain Google services associated with your 
						account (such as Gmail and Google Docs/Drive). This access is 
						<strong>only</strong> used to manage team communications on your 
						behalf.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>We do not collect your personal data for our own use. We 
						do not sell, distribute, or share your data with any third parties.
						</strong> Our Service acts as a secure tool to perform tasks you 
						initiate.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Google API Services Limited Use Policy</h2>
					<p>
						Virtual Team Parent's use and transfer to any other app of information 
						received from Google APIs will adhere to the 
						<a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, 
						including the Limited Use requirements.
					</p>
					<p>
						Notwithstanding any other provision in this Privacy Policy:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>No Advertising:</strong> We do not use any data accessed from 
						Google APIs (such as Gmail, Drive, or Sheets) for advertising purposes.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Limited Human Access:</strong> No human at The Beynum Company 
						or Virtual Team Parent will read your data (such as emails, file 
						contents, or sheet data) unless we have your explicit, affirmative 
						consent for a specific purpose (e.g., resolving a support issue), 
						or if it is necessary for security purposes or to comply with 
						applicable law.
					</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Google Services Access and Purpose</h2>
					<p>
						With your permission, our Service accesses the following Google APIs 
						for the sole purposes listed:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>User Info API (userinfo.email, userinfo.profile):</strong> 
						To authenticate you and identify your account.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Gmail API (gmail.modify):</strong> To allow you to send 
						"Coach Broadcast" emails from your own account. This scope is also 
						used to read image or PDF attachments from your messages from the
						coach, that will be included in emails to parents (OCR).
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Google Drive API (drive.file):</strong> Used exclusively 
						for the OCR process. The app temporarily uploads an attachment 
						read from Gmail, copies it to trigger Google's OCR, extracts 
						the text, and then immediately deletes these temporary files 
						from your Drive.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Google Sheets API (spreadsheets):</strong> To access and 
						update specific Google Sheets that you designate for managing 
						parent email lists, volunteer signups and team fund requests.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Google Vertex AI (Gemini API):</strong> To help you draft 
						communications. We send the text you provide (including text 
						extracted via OCR) to the Gemini API to generate draft emails 
						for your review.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Google OAuth2 (openid, email, profile):</strong> To securely 
						handle user authentication and authorization.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Google Forms API (forms.body):</strong> To automatically 
						update the options list of volunteer spots on the signup Google 
						Form for new events and after a signup is received.
					</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Data Sharing and Distribution</h2>
					<p>
						Because we do not collect your data for our own purposes, we 
						have no data to sell, share, or distribute. Any data accessed 
						(e.g., from a Google Sheet) is only used to perform the requested 
						action (e.g., send an email to your team) and is not stored by us.
					</p>

					<h2>Data Storage</h2>
					<p>
						Our Service operates without storing your personal data on our 
						servers. We do not save copies of the emails you send or the 
						textcontent of the documents we access. Any information required 
						for the app to function (such as your authorization token for 
						Google or team contact lists you provide) is handled securely 
						and is not used for any purpose other than operating the Service.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
					<p>
						Our Service is a tool intended for managing administrative 
						communication <strong>between adults</strong> (coaches and 
						parents/guardians).
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The Service is not intended for, and must not be used for, 
						communicating any information or data about children or students 
						on the team.</strong> This includes, but is not limited to, student 
						names, performance, grades, health information, or any other 
						personally identifiable information (PII) related to a minor.
					</p>
					<p>
						We do not knowingly collect, process, or store any PII related 
						to children. The User (coach, school, etc.) is responsible for 
						ensuring that all content processed by the Service complies 
						with this policy, their school's policies, and all applicable 
						laws, including COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) 
						and FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act).
					</p>
					<p>
						Any use of the Service to transmit such information is considered 
						misuse and a direct violation of our Terms of Service.
					</p>

					<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>
						We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will 
						notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on 
						this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy 
						periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy 
						are effective when they are posted on this page.
					</p>
