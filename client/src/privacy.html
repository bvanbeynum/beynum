					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
					<p class="last-updated">Last Updated: October 30, 2025</p>

					<p>The Beynum Company ("we," "us," or "our") operates the Virtual Team Parent application (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy is to inform you of our policies regarding the access, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service. </p>
					
					<p>Our commitment to you is simple: <strong>We respect your privacy.</strong> We have designed our Service to be a tool that *you* control, operating with your explicit permission.</p>

					<h2>Our Data Policy: Limited Use with Your Permission</h2>
					<p>
						To function, the Virtual Team Parent service requires your explicit permission to access certain Google services associated with your account (such as Gmail and Google Docs/Drive). This access is *only* used to manage team communications on your behalf.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>We do not collect your personal data for our own use. We do not sell, distribute, or share your data with any third parties.</strong> Our Service acts as a secure tool to perform tasks you initiate.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Google Services Access</h2>
					<p>
						With your permission, our Service may access the following Google services for the sole purposes listed:
					</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem;">
						<li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Google Gmail API:</strong> To send emails (such as blast communications and weekly updates) *from your account* to the parents and players on your team. We do not read, store, or delete your other emails.</li>
						<li style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"><strong>Google Drive / Docs API:</strong> To access specific documents (such as team rosters or highlight notes) that you explicitly give the script access to. This allows the Service to pull information for team updates and insights. We do not access, read, or modify any other files in your Google Drive.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Data Sharing and Distribution</h2>
					<p>
						Because we do not collect your data for our own purposes, we have no data to sell, share, or distribute. Any data accessed (e.g., from a Google Doc) is only used to perform the requested action (e.g., send an email to your team) and is not stored by us.
					</p>

					<h2>Data Storage</h2>
					<p>
						Our Service operates without storing your personal data on our servers. We do not save copies of the emails you send or the content of the documents we access. Any information required for the app to function (such as your authorization token for Google or team contact lists you provide) is handled securely and is not used for any purpose other than operating the Service.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
					<p>
						Our Service is intended for use by high school sports teams, which may include users under the age of 18. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do not knowingly, or unknowingly, collect any personally identifiable information from anyone, including children under 18.
					</p>

					<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>
						We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
					</p>

					<h2>Contact Us</h2>
					<p>
						If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@thebeynum.company">privacy@thebeynum.company</a>
